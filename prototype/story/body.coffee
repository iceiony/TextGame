    Willy walks past the officers and approaches the body. They follow his lead.
    Chief : That's how we found him. The medical personnel inspected him briefly.
    Henry : They said some of his bones are broken and he has a skull fracture.
            He is not bruised, and just has a few lesions.
    Stevey : You know what's weird, there is just no blood around. Like at all.

    As they get next to the body Willy kneels next to it to examine. The earth feels slightly humid because of the storm last night.

    Body is faced up, a middle aged white male, maybe 45 and 90kq, half naked.
    His right fist seems to be closed in a tight grip. Willy could smell a faint aroma of alcohol from that distance.

        There are 5-6 other people present: the three officers, 2 paramedics and a farmer.
        The farmer is sitting by his tractor, parked a about 20 meters away towards the road.
        And also... there is the body .

        Willy looks around .

        No blood and no tracks to indicate that the body may have been dragged to that location.

        The detective attempts to search the victim.
        There is not much to search through, given the victim is not wearing a shirt.
        He puts his hands through the trousers pockets but can't find anything.

        Henry : We've searched him as well. We couldn't find anything.

            Chief : What gives you that crazy idea?
            Willy : The deep imprint on the ground. The broken bones. The fact that there are no signs of the body being dragged here.
            Henry : What about if he was carried here?
            Willy : Given the earth is this soft after the rain last night. I would expect to see some deep foot prints around.
                    But there is nothing.
            Stevey : Actually, I know there was this large festival yesterday a few towns away.
                     They had balloon flights too. Maybe there was some trouble from the storm last night.
            Chief : Alright Willy, I think we know what we have to do now. Henry, get in contact with that festival.
                    Thanks for your help detective. Think you've cracked this.

        The body, although seemingly lying flat, was buried about 4cm deep.
        The shape of the imprint had the features of the body itself.

        Wildcard rolls him to the side and pushes him all the way out of the crater. He notices how sludgy the body feels and how
        most of the bone anatomy doesn't feel right .

            Willy opens the fist of the man without much effort. It wasn't very stiff. Seems he was holding a short match, unused.
            The detective picks up the match staring at it curiously.
            The match seems to have been broken in two, and now only the top half could be found.

                While completely avoiding eye contact with the Chief's intensive stare, he strikes the match on the side of his shoe and proceeds to light his cigar.
