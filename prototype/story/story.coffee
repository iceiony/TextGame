        Crime scene investigation
        In the middle of an empty field in the early hours of Sunday morning. Three policement discuss a most peculiar case.

        Chief : This sure is an odd one Henry.
        Henry : Sure is cheif.
        Chief : I think, to crack this one, we might need to call some special help.
        Henry : Do you mean, call THAT guy?
        Stevey: Oh ! Surely not that oddball. What the heck are we getting him for?
        Chief : He's odd alright. But oddly he's still better than the three of us put together.
                Besides Stevey, you've never met him before, so what are complaining about.
        Stevey: Hmph! I've heared plenty of stories. ( he says disapprovingly )
        Henry : Alright, I'll give him a call chief.

            Far in the distance a car slows to a stop. An old mustang, a muscle car.
